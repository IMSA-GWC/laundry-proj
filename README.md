# Laundry @ IMSA

## Problem
At IMSA, students struggle to have their laundry done on time because they are either all full, or they forget to pick up the laundry. 

## Solution
We look to construct a website where IMSA students can check which laundry machines are currently being used, and set up a queue to claim your usage of a washer/dryer.

### Resources
* Database that can hold the information:
  *time start
  *user 
  *hall
  *availability - queue
* Website both mobile and browser compatible
 *Bootstrap can easily respond to mobile
 *tabs for different halls? 
 *Form to connect to the database, and enter in your own
* Login from IMSA account so no spam? (no more than how many of the washers and dryers there are
